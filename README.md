# Plot.ly Visualizations - Belly Button Biodiversity


Plotly was used to  build an interactive dashboard displaying visualizations on Belly Button Biodiversity data, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Data can be found here: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/),

Visualizations include: (1) a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 bacterial samples (OTUs) found in that individual; (2) a bubble chart that displays all samples for the individual selected in the dropdown menu; and (3) a side panel containing metadata for the selected individual, i.e., an individual's demographic information. Importantly, JavaScript was ued to udpate all of the plots any time that a new individual is selected.
